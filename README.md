# Soupbot

A simple discord bot to handle Nintendo SOAP operations for the nintendo 3DS.

Currently only generates data jsons for further uses with [Cleaninty](https://github.com/luigoalma/cleaninty).

Requires a functional Cleaninty setup, which requires dumping keys from a 3DS unit. Read the Cleaninty "documentation" for more information.
